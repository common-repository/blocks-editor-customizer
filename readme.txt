Good news everyone: our favorite WordPress editor - now even more convenient!

The block editor functionality is a great step forward in making WordPress user-friendlier. It’s intuitive, it allows for lots of things, but could it be more flexible?

Meet the Blocks Editor Interface Customizer - the WordPress plugin that will make the Gutenberg editor an even better tool!

With Blocks Editor Interface Customizer, you can adjust the WordPress block editor to fit your needs: from screen size to colors. This plugin allows setting the desired field width for the main editor and the sidebar. And not only that: Gutenberg Customizer provides the Dark Mode for the editor. Configure your work area and let it aid your productivity, not hamper it.

<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>

<strong>1. Editor width</strong>

Planning to have a full-screen paragraph on a page? Want to see how long lines of text would look? Customizing the width of the editor can come in really handy in cases like that - and in many more.

<strong><strong>2. Sidebar width</strong>

Now it’s up to you how much room to leave for tools. Gutenberg Customizer will let you stretch or shrink the sidebar to the perfect size so that it attracts just the right amount of attention.

<strong>3. Dark mode</strong>

However convenient the block editor is, it’s far from pleasant to work in it when it’s much brighter than the surroundings. The Dark Mode feature of the Gutenberg customizer plugin ensures your eyes are comfortable in dim light.

Coming soon: Eye Care Mode

Improve your work conditions even more! With the next update, we’re adding the Eye Care Mode with warmer colors. Too much blue light from digital screens is no good for the eyes. Make your Gutenberg editor colors adjustable regardless of the device you work from.

<h2><strong>Why we prefer Gutenberg over the page builders for WordPress?</strong></h2>

- If you develop a website using third-party builders, you corner yourself in a situation where you’ll need this particular editor/builder installed, or some things may not work. That’s not the case with the built-in editor.

- Additional stuff installed equals additional load on your site. If you want your site to be fast, you should keep it lightweight.

We always use the native WordPress block editor when working on a website. And we know how important it is to enjoy using your tools. That’s what Blocks Editor Interface Customizer is for.

Gutenberg Customizer is the best way to make website development run even more smoothly.

<strong>- Set comfortable dimensions</strong>

Gutenberg Customizer will help you make your editor represent the layout of your future site. Try working with a more flexible interface: your convenience matters!

<strong>- Keep your eyes comfy</strong>

Some like using darker colors for the lower-key light, some - for the stylish look. But that’s surely something that will make you more satisfied with the work process.

<strong>- Stay healthy</strong>

Your vision needs less stress and better color temperature. The Eye Care Mode in Gutenberg Customizer will be on the lookout for your health.

While you make your site convenient for users, Gutenberg Customizer will take care of your comfort. Work with ease and love what you do more than ever.
